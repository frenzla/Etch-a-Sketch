# Etch-a-Sketch

Pretty neat toy to flex my nascent DOM manipulation skills. This is a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

Built with JavaScript, HTML & CSS.

Part of my coding mastering journey ü•∑

**Assignment:** [Project: Etch-a-Sketch](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch)

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Objective: Create a webpage with a user-defined sized grid of square divs. Set up a ‚Äúhover‚Äù effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Extra credit:
1. Rather than squares being the same color throughout the grid, randomize the squares‚Äô RGB values with each interaction.
2. Additionally, implement a progressive darkening effect where each interaction darkens the square by 10%. The goal is to achieve a fully black (or completely colored) square in only ten interactions.


## How to Install and Run the Project

`git clone` the project and open the *index.html* file


## How to Use

Move your mouse within the square's limits to see colors popping up. If you want to change pixels' size click on "Change grid size".
